5. SQL Joins
SQL Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column.

Types of Joins in SQL:
INNER JOIN – Returns matching records from both tables
LEFT JOIN – Returns all records from the left table + matched records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN – Returns all records from the right table + matched records from the left table
FULL JOIN – Returns all records from both tables (matched + unmatched)
SELF JOIN – Joins a table with itself
CROSS JOIN – Returns the Cartesian product of both tables
